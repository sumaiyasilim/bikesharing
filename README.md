# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. In order to showcase this, charts were created to show three things:
-	The length of time that bikes are checked out, categorized by gender
-	The number of bike trips for all riders for each hour of each day of the week, categorized by gender
-	The number of bike trips for each type of use for each day of the week, categorized by gender

## Results
### Start/End Locations

These graphs allow us to visualize where we should expect the most usage from the bikes. In the “Top Starting Location” graph, the blue dots represent the most popular start areas. In the “Top Ending Location” graph, the purple represents the most popular end areas. By hovering over the circles on each map, we’ll be able to get the count of bikes and the names of the station.
### Checkout Times

These graphs show us how long each trip is on average. In general, majority of the people return their bikes once their ride has hit an hour. The other chart, “Checkout Time by Gender”, shows us that male’s checkout more bikes and their rides tend to last a bit longer than the others.
### Trip by Weekday for Each Hour

This graph shows the peak times of when the highest number of trips are happening. It does this by showing us the breakdown of the hours within the days. The darker red areas are when the highest number of trips are happening. We can see that during the weekdays, the peak hours are right around when people would start and finish work, so around 8am then around 5 to 6pm. On weekends, the peak times are between 12pm to 5pm as most people are off these days.
### Trip by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This graph shows the peak usage times of the bikes by gender. The highest number of trips are still occurring the same as in the “Trip by Weekday for Each Hour” chart, but this chart breaks it down by gender. In general, there are about 3 times as many men using the bikes as women.
### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This graph is a heatmap indicating the number of bike trips by gender. It also breaks it up into user types, showing how many people who use it are customers and how many people who use it are subscribers. We can see that a majority of riders are males who are subscribers. 

## Summary
In conclusion, these charts have given us an insight on what can be expected if this bike-sharing program was to be implemented in Des Moines. We are able to visualize the possible peak times and also get a grasp on who our target market is. Although it is also important to note that New York is a city where using anything but a car is ideal, so if it’s a similar situation in Des Moines, then implementing this program would be successful and yield similar results as the ones we see in New York.
### Additional Visualizations
1.	In order to better understand who the target audience is, we could create a chart that breaks down the users by age and gender. This way we know who exactly is using the bike-sharing program and market to them accordingly. 
2.	In order to determine the primary use of the bikes, we could create a chart that can show to show the distance travelled within each trip by the areas. This would allow us to figure out the most popluar routes and determine the reason the bikes are being used.
